## Description
This project was initially developed as an assignment for the [TU Berlin Programming Project in Python [WiSe 2024/25]](https://isis.tu-berlin.de/course/view.php?id=40758). In this project, [Connect4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) is implemented using fundamental concepts of "software carpentry", including:
- Use of a version control system, such as Git
- Test-driven development
- Documentation
- Debugging, profiling, and optimization
- (Optional) Issue tracking and milestones for project planning
- (Optional) Software design and associated artifacts, e.g., activity/class diagrams

This is the first submission of the prototype for the Connect4 game project.  
For the full, detailed project (demo, venv, pylint, coverage, ...), visit my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/akekesi/Connect4).
